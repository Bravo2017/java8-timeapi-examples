# Java 8 Date and Time API (in Java 7 and Java 8)

Presentation on the new Java 8 Date and Time API. PowerPoint included. Fully working code examples included. Solutions to [Java 8 Time API Examples] included as well. This project also includes JUnit tests to explain how the code should behave.


## Java 8

Discard the Maven pom.xml. Re-do all imports to use the the `java.time.*` package names from the Java 8 JDK.

### How to Use in Java 8

- Install the latest versions of [Java 8]
- Install a version of [Eclipse] that supports Java 8
- Open the java8-timeapi-examples project in Eclipse
- Take a look at the Java code
- Run the JUnit tests to see how the code is expected to work
- Experiment!


## Java 7

This project uses the  [ThreeTen] libraries to allow you to use the Java 8 Time API in Java 7. (Of course, the package names are different.) 

Use the Maven pom.xml. Re-do all imports to use the the package names from the [ThreeTen] libraries.

### How to Use in Java 7

- Install the latest versions of [Java 7] and [Apache Maven]
- Install [Eclipse], and the Maven m2e plugin for Eclipse
- Open the java8-timeapi-examples project in Eclipse
- Take a look at the Java code
- Run the JUnit tests to see how the code is expected to work
- Experiment!
